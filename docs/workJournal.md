# Reddoor Maintenance — Work Journal

Running log of build work: what was done, why, and where it landed.
Chronological — newest entry at the bottom. [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) holds the
standing rules; `AUTONOMY.md` holds what a session may decide alone; this is the
history of arriving at both.

The convention is in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) under "The work journal": every
working session appends a dated entry, prose over bullets, why over what.
**History is never edited to be right** — an entry that stops being true is
corrected by a later entry that says which one it corrects.

## 2026-09-05 — Journal opened, CLAUDE.md brought back into version control, and 743 commits summarised rather than reconstructed (`chore/work-journal`)

Two things land together, and the second is the reason the first is worth having.

**The backfill, and its trust boundary.** The journal starts today, so this entry
is a deliberately coarse summary written from the commit log rather than from
memory. Detail below this line is trustworthy; detail above it is not, and
nothing here should be cited as though someone wrote it down at the time. The
commit log, `CHANGELOG.md` and the specs under `docs/superpowers/` remain the
record for anything before 2026-09-05.

**What this repo is.** `@reddoorla/maintenance` — the central fleet system for
every Reddoor site. It is simultaneously a CLI, a library the sites depend on for
their shared configs and test harnesses, a set of nightly audits, a report
generator and mailer, a Netlify-hosted operator dashboard, and the forms ingest
every site's contact form posts to. 743 commits on `main` from 2026-05-20 to
2026-09-04, currently v0.93.1, with **369 TypeScript source files against 471
test files** — a ratio that is itself a statement of intent for a system whose
failures are mostly silent.

**The eras, from the month counts.** May (193) is the CLI, the recipes and the
first audits, including the Svelte 5 codemods. June (259, the peak) is the
reports pipeline, the dashboard, forms and the fleet cockpit — and the autonomy
docs, i.e. the month the system started acting on its own findings rather than
only reporting them. July (127) is overwhelmingly Blux: `src/blux` is still the
largest directory in the repo at 63 files, more than `src/reports` (43) or
`src/audits` (33). August (135) is the Turso `src/db` layer and more dashboard.
September (29 so far) is almost entirely `prospect`, the external AEO/SEO audit
that scores a site nobody here controls.

**In flight, as of this entry.** `feat/audit-check-battery` is 34 commits ahead
of `main`, pushed, with no PR open — the `prospect` work. The only open PR is
#692, the changeset release, which is human-merge-only per `AUTONOMY.md`. The
Airtable → Turso migration is Phase 5→6: **Turso has been authoritative since
2026-08-31 (`dadb073`)** and Airtable is a swallowed shadow write pending
deletion, deferred on issue #539. Two issues were filed today against naming and
reporting debt that migration left behind — #697 (the a11y audit's pass summary
reports the fixture count, not the routes it actually ran) and #698 (1,835
occurrences of `airtable` in a namespace that now describes the wrong store).

**CLAUDE.md is tracked again, and that is a reversal.** It had been excluded from
version control in `.git/info/exclude` — never committed, no history — because
this repo is public and the file names where the Discord bot token lives, the
guild id, and which members of a client channel are Reddoor staff versus the
client. A rollout session stopped rather than commit it, which was the right call
to make without asking. Tucker's decision today is to track it: reviewed on the
basis that **none of that is a credential value** — the token line says where the
secret lives, not what it is, and the two snowflake ids are visible to anyone in
the server. The `#sonder` staff-vs-client note is the one genuinely
business-confidential line, and it goes public knowingly.

The cost of the old arrangement is what makes this worth recording. The standing
rules for the most complex repo in the fleet existed only on one machine. They
were not reviewable, not diffable, and not present for anyone — human or agent —
working from a fresh clone; every lesson in that file was one `rm -rf` from
gone. The reason to track it is the same reason to keep a journal.

**One thing this session did wrong here, recorded because the journal is for
this.** Earlier today a `git checkout main && git pull` was run in the main
checkout. The checkout failed silently — `main` was already checked out in
`.worktrees/ts-verdict`, and git refuses a second checkout of the same branch —
but the `&&` chain still reached `git pull`, which merged `origin/main` into
`feat/audit-check-battery` and left a merge commit on another session's WIP
branch. Nothing was lost (the merge was clean and orthogonal; that branch's own
files are byte-identical across it), and by the time it was noticed the other
session had committed on top, so undoing it would have destroyed real work. It
stays. This is exactly the collision CLAUDE.md's "never commit from the main
checkout" rule exists to prevent, and it happened by treating a shared checkout
as a place to run a quick read-only command.
